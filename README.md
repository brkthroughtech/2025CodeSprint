# Welcome to the 2025 Break Through Tech Code Sprint! 👋 
Over the next 6 weeks, you'll find a number of to-dos and curated resources to help you prepare for your coding interviews for opportunities in tech. Whether you're preparing for software engineering or ML coding interviews in big tech, Fortune 500s, or startups, everything you need will be here.  
## Why This Exists 
As you likely know, the coding screen or technical assessment is a critical part of many interviews for internships and full-time roles technical positions. For many, preparing for these technical assessments can be time-consuming and stressful. Worse, if you’ve ever bombed one (we all have!), then preparing for technical screens might also feel demoralizing and anxiety-inducing. 

Preparing for technical interviews is a learned skill, and it is a numbers game. Don’t believe us? Listen to the data: 
- Only 20% of candidates perform consistently from interview to interview
- Candidates who completed 5+ interviews were 2X more likely to pass Facebook’s phone screen than those who only completed 1-4 interviews
- Women tend to quit interview practice 7X more often than men after just one bad interview

**We’re here to help.** Break Through Tech is excited to support by launching our Coding Sprint. We’ve curated some of our favorite review resources and interview questions so that you don’t have to.

## How to Participate
- Visit this Site each Monday at noon to find a problem set of 6 of our favorite Leetcode questions
- Copy the Leetcode List and practice the problems in your own Leetcode account
- Throughout the week, we'll share hints and other tips for success to help you along the way
- By 11:59pm ET (midnight) fill out the survey to tell us how many problems you've solved (*please note: you'll also be asked to share a screenshot of the Leetcode List to illustrate your progress*)
- Check Slack on Monday for an updated leaderboard for who has successfully answered the most questions and a link to the next problem set
- After 6 weeks, we'll announce our winners who win a free mock interview from interviewing.io (the top 3 fellows on the leaderboard, plus 5 more fellows selected by raffle)

## Tips for Success 
Not all practice is created equal. If you find yourself unmotivated or discouraged grinding Leetcode, you're not alone. To make it a little less daunting, consider some of our tips for success below: 
- 🧠 **Practice like the real thing.** The best way to simulate the real thing, is to practice like it is. Try solving each problem without the assistance of syntax highlighting in your IDE. Solve problems both iteratively and recursively to practice different solution approaches. And don't use AI-assisted tools to do the intellectual heavy lifting. 
- 🌱 **Develop a habit.** Solve one problem a day during your morning coffee, on the train, or before you close your laptop for the evening. The more you can make practice a part of your daily routine, the more likely you are to stick with it. 
- 👯 **Make it social.** Find a buddy from your AI Studio team or the Slack channel and find time for pair-programming. If you're having fun, you're much more likely to keep it up than if it feels like a chore.
- 🔭 **Reflect on your practice.** Compile your code after you are done to check for any errors. Make a journal and jot down common mistakes, topics that give you trouble, or new solution approaches that you like and want to apply to other problems. The more you codify your lessons learned the less likely you'll be to make the same mistake twice.
